### Transmission-bt RPC GUI client for iOS

Rich RPC client for transmission-bt servers.
As you know, these days almost every modern WiFi home router has a build-in torrent server and it is a transmission-bt. Transmission-bt is great, it's open-sourced and it has a huge fan community.
Though android community has a lot of client implementations, sadly the iOS-one is lack of that and I think this is a big misfortune. AppStore had some clients with a very poor functionality but even those clients were removed (after I tried to submit this app and had a not very pleasant argue with appstore team about this app). My intention was to create a decent client that I would use every day by myself. Finally after all of the discussions appstore team rejected the app. So I share it for all, download/build & compile, use and enjoy, the project is already updated for XCode 9.0 !

**TransShift can/is:**

- support iOS 8.0 and above (actually it's 7.0 ready, but XCode 9 supports only 8.0 min)
- implement almost 100% of RPC functionality and even more. 
- universal app
- minified size, doesn't use any third party libraries, very fast on any device
- read original torrent files and shows the full content tree of .torrent file
